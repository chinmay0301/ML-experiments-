# ML-experiments
Learning and experimenting a bit with ML 

I made this repo as to upload whatever little or big things I code while learning ML. Using Tensorflow as of now.
Will try `scikit-learn` also soon. Share anything u develop or tinker around while learning ML 

## NAND gate 

Made a NAND gate using a neural network with one hidden layer and 10 nodes. The last line of the code can be changed
to give the boolean input tuple of your choice and corresponding `one_hot` output values. Just a basic code, but was fun!
